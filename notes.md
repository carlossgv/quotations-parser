## Part I: HOW THE SLIGHT EDGE WORKS

**1. The Beach Bum and the Millionaire >  Page 32**
> Things like taking a few dollars out of a paycheck, putting it into savings, and leaving it there. Or doing a few minutes of exercise every day— and not skipping it. Or reading ten pages of an inspiring, educational, life- changing book every day. Or taking a moment to tell someone how much you appreciate them, and doing that consistently, every day, for months and years. Little things that seem insignificant in the doing, yet when compounded over time yield very big results.

**2. The First Ingredient >  Page 48**
> There is a natural progression to everything in life: plant, cultivate, harvest.

**3. The Choice >  Page 67**
> Simple productive actions, repeated consistently over time. Simple errors in judgment, repeated consistently over time.

**3. The Choice >  Page 67**
> The choice is that simple.

**3. The Choice >  Page 68**
> the things you do every single day, the things that don’t look dramatic, that don’t even look like they matter, do matter. That they not only make a difference— they make all the difference.

**6. Don’t Fall for Quantum Leap >  Page 124**
> Believing in the “big break” is worse than simply being futile. It’s actually dangerous, because it can keep you from taking the actions you need to take to create the results you want.

**7. The Secret of Happiness >  Page 133**
> How you realize happiness is by doing some simple things, and doing them every day.

**7. The Secret of Happiness >  Page 137**
> It isn’t the result of getting all the other stuff right, but something you can do right now, and that then leads to getting the other stuff right.

**7. The Secret of Happiness >  Page 142**
> Happiness. The perfect workout partner for the slight edge.

**8. The Ripple Effect >  Page 152**
> I can’t remember ever feeling really overwhelmed by anything I wanted to do, because I always knew that all it took was to break up that bigger goal up into pieces and then consistently work on those little chunks.

## Part II: LIVING THE SLIGHT EDGE

**10. Two Life Paths >  Page 192**
> They understand that it is not what happens to them that’s important, but how they respond to what happens that makes the difference between their failure and success.

**10. Two Life Paths >  Page 195**
> People on the failure curve tend to focus on their past— and it pulls them down. People on the success curve focus on their future. And you can guess what happens: it pulls them up.

**10. Two Life Paths >  Page 197**
> You can’t change the past. You can change the future. Would you rather be influenced by something you can’t change, or by something you can?

**10. Two Life Paths >  Page 205**
> Everything is always in motion. Every day, every moment, your life path is either curving upward, or curving downward.

**10. Two Life Paths >  Page 205**
> People on the success curve live in responsibility. People on the failure curve live in blame.

**11. Mastering the Slight Edge >  Page 210**
> Are there any situations in your life today where you’ve given up and decided to keep crawling for the rest of your life, rather than go for what you really want, what you truly deserve? Have you let go of the capacity to make up a goal, go for it, and get it? If so, you have to ask yourself, why is it so difficult, so impossible, to do something today that you had no trouble doing when you were less than a year old? The answer is as simple as it is sad: somewhere along the way, you lost faith. You became too grown- up to take baby steps, too sure you would never succeed to let yourself fail a few times first.

**11. Mastering the Slight Edge >  Page 211**
> “There is one quality which one must possess to win,” writes Napoleon Hill in his all- time classic Think and Grow Rich, “and that is definiteness of purpose, the knowledge of what one wants, and a burning desire to possess it.”

**11. Mastering the Slight Edge >  Page 217**
> Stretching for what you could be, or settling for what you are. There is simply no in- between.

**11. Mastering the Slight Edge >  Page 218**
> This means changing your thinking about the comfort zone. It’s a change in philosophy. It means embracing living uncomfortably in order to attain a life that is genuinely comfortable— not deceptively comfortable.

**12. Invest in Yourself >  Page 236**
> Would you like me to give you the formula for success? It’s quite simple, really. Double your rate of failure.… You’re thinking of failure as the enemy of success. But it isn’t at all. You can be discouraged by failure— or you can learn from it. So go ahead and make mistakes. Make all you can. Because, remember that’s where you’ll find success. On the other side of failure.

**12. Invest in Yourself >  Page 245**
> Learning by studying and learning by doing— book smarts and street smarts— are the two essential pistons of the engine of learning.

**14. Use Your Slight Edge Allies >  Page 272**
> “People who feel good about themselves produce good results.”

**15. Cultivate Slight Edge Habits >  Page 281**
> Habit #1: Show Up

**15. Cultivate Slight Edge Habits >  Page 282**

**15. Cultivate Slight Edge Habits >  Page 287**
> Habit #4: Be Committed for the Long Haul

**15. Cultivate Slight Edge Habits >  Page 289**
> Habit #5: Cultivate a Burning Desire Backed by Faith

**15. Cultivate Slight Edge Habits >  Page 290**
> burning desire backed by faith simply means deeply, passionately wanting to get somewhere and knowing— not hoping, not wishing, but knowing that you’re going to get there.

**15. Cultivate Slight Edge Habits >  Page 291**
> Habit #6: Be Willing to Pay the Price

**15. Cultivate Slight Edge Habits >  Page 293**
> “Is that too large a price to pay?” is a question only you can answer. Remember this: whatever price you pay, there’s a bigger price to pay for not doing it than the price for doing it.

**15. Cultivate Slight Edge Habits >  Page 293**
> Habit #7: Practice Slight Edge Integrity

**15. Cultivate Slight Edge Habits >  Page 293**
> The aspect of integrity that is most applicable to the slight edge is this: what you do when no one is watching.

**15. Cultivate Slight Edge Habits >  Page 294**
> “You know,” you say to yourself, “if I skip the ten pages, just for tonight, it’s no big deal.” And you know what? You’re absolutely right. It’s not going to make a huge difference, one way or the other. It is no big deal. And in that moment, you find out who you really are.

**15. Cultivate Slight Edge Habits >  Page 294**
> it’s at that moment that you find out whether or not you have slight edge integrity.

**16. Three Steps to Your Dreams >  Page 302**
> You must make it specific, give it a deadline, and write it down. You must look at it every day. You must have a plan to start with.

**16. Three Steps to Your Dreams >  Page 305**
> Step Two: Look at It Every Day

**16. Three Steps to Your Dreams >  Page 307**
> Step Three: Start with a Plan

**16. Three Steps to Your Dreams >  Page 307**
> The point is simply to come up with a plan that will get you out of the starting gate.

**16. Three Steps to Your Dreams >  Page 308**
> The power of a plan is not that it will get you there. The power of a plan is that it will get you started.

**17. Living the Slight Edge >  Page 321**
> modern business world has an expression for this mindset: “Assume nothing.” The Zen Buddhists call it “beginner’s mind.”

**17. Living the Slight Edge >  Page 325**
> Remember: success does not lead to happiness— it’s the other way around.

**17. Living the Slight Edge >  Page 329**
> You will become as small as your controlling desire, or as great as your dominant aspiration.
