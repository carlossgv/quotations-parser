## THE EVOLUTION OF MASTERY

**Page 30**
> Having mastered a particular skill— tracking prey, fashioning a tool— it was now automatic, and so while practicing the skill the mind no longer had to focus on the specific actions involved but instead could concentrate on something higher— what the prey might be thinking, how the tool could be felt as part of the hand.

## KEYS TO MASTERY

**Page 37**
> A natural response when people feel overwhelmed is to retreat into various forms of passivity. If we don’t try too much in life, if we limit our circle of action, we can give ourselves the illusion of control. The less we attempt, the less chances of failure.

**Page 39**
> First, you must see your attempt at attaining mastery as something extremely necessary and positive.

**Page 39**
> The passive ironic attitude is not cool or romantic, but pathetic and destructive.

**Page 39**
> Second, you must convince yourself of the following: people get the mind and quality of brain that they deserve through their actions in life.

## THE LIFE’S TASK

**Page 44**
> The first move toward mastery is always inward— learning who you really are and reconnecting with that innate force. Knowing it with clarity, you will find your way to the proper career path and everything else will fall into place. It is never too late to start this process.

## THE HIDDEN FORCE

**Page 49**
> but in fact he regretted nothing from this experience. He had been able to test out his ideas on how to engineer large- scale projects; he would apply this knowledge elsewhere. Anyway, he didn’t care so much about the finished product; it was the search and process in creating something that had always excited him.

**Page 52**
> How can we explain such inclinations? They are forces within us that come from a deeper place than conscious words can express. They draw us to certain experiences and away from others.

**Page 53**
> The process of realizing your Life’s Task comes in three stages: First, you must connect or reconnect with your inclinations, that sense of uniqueness.

**Page 53**
> Second, with this connection established, you must look at the career path you are already on or are about to begin.

**Page 54**
> Finally, you must see your career or vocational path more as a journey with twists and turns rather than a straight line.

**Page 55**
> Think of it this way: What we lack most in the modern world is a sense of a larger purpose to our lives.

## STRATEGIES FOR FINDING YOUR LIFE’S TASK

> STRATEGIES FOR FINDING YOUR LIFE’S TASK

## 1. Return to your origins—The primal inclination strategy

**Page 58**
> Return to your origins— The primal inclination strategy

**Page 60**
> You must understand the following: In order to master a field, you must love the subject and feel a profound connection to it.

**Page 61**
> You must dig for signs of such inclinations in your earliest years. Look for its traces in visceral reactions to something simple; a desire to repeat an activity that you never tired of; a subject that stimulated an unusual degree of curiosity; feelings of power attached to particular actions.

## 2. Occupy the perfect niche—The Darwinian strategy

**Page 62**
> Occupy the perfect niche— The Darwinian strategy

**Page 67**
> The game you want to play is different: to instead find a niche in the ecology that you can dominate.

## 3. Avoid the false path—The rebellion strategy

**Page 69**
> Avoid the false path— The rebellion strategy

## 4. Let go of the past—The adaptation strategy

**Page 73**
> Let go of the past— The adaptation strategy

**Page 75**
> You are not tied to a particular position; your loyalty is not to a career or a company. You are committed to your Life’s Task, to giving it full expression.

**Page 76**
> Remember: your Life’s Task is a living, breathing organism.

## 5. Find your way back—The life-or-death strategy

**Page 77**
> Find your way back— The life- or- death strategy

**Page 80**
> You must listen to the message of this frustration, this pain, and let it guide you as clearly as Fuller’s voice guided him. It is a matter of life and death.

## REVERSAL

**Page 84**
> ignore your weaknesses and resist the temptation to be more like others. Instead, like Temple Grandin, direct yourself toward the small things you are good at. Do not dream or make grand plans for the future, but instead concentrate on becoming proficient at these simple and immediate skills. This will bring you confidence and become a base from which you can expand to other pursuits.

## KEYS TO MASTERY

**Page 95**
> We tend to be somewhat socially naïve and unprepared for the political games people play.

**Page 96**
> The principle is simple and must be engraved deeply in your mind: the goal of an apprenticeship is not money, a good position, a title, or a diploma, but rather the transformation of your mind and character— the first transformation on the way to mastery.

## Step One: Deep Observation—The Passive Mode

**Page 100**
> You are not there to change that culture; you will only end up being killed, or in the case of work, fired. Later, when you have attained power and mastery, you will be the one to rewrite or destroy these same rules.

## Step Two: Skills Acquisition—The Practice Mode

**Page 105**
> First, it is essential that you begin with one skill that you can master, and that serves as a foundation for acquiring others. You must avoid at all cost the idea that you can manage learning several skills at a time. You need to develop your powers of concentration, and understand that trying to multitask will be the death of the process.

**Page 105**
> Too many people believe that everything must be pleasurable in life, which makes them constantly search for distractions and short- circuits the learning process.

**Page 108**
> In essence, when you practice and develop any skill you transform yourself in the process. You reveal to yourself new capabilities that were previously latent, that are exposed as you progress. You develop emotionally. Your sense of pleasure becomes redefined. What offers immediate pleasure comes to seem like a distraction, an empty entertainment to help pass the time.

## 1. Value learning over money

**Page 114**
> Value learning over money

## 4. Trust the process

**Page 134**
> Whenever we learn a skill, we frequently reach a point of frustration— what we are learning seems beyond our capabilities. Giving in to these feelings, we unconsciously quit on ourselves before we actually give up.

**Page 135**
> What you can do is have faith in the process. The boredom will go away once you enter the cycle. The panic disappears after repeated exposure. The frustration is a sign of progress— a signal that your mind is processing complexity and requires more practice. The insecurities will transform into their opposites when you gain mastery. Trusting this will all happen, you will allow the natural learning process to move forward, and everything else will fall into place.

## 6. Apprentice yourself in failure

**Page 145**
> If you fail in this way, the hit that you take to your reputation is greatly outweighed by what you learn. Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done.

## 2. Gaze deep into the mentor’s mirror

**Page 190**
> seems abusive or damaging to people’s self- esteem to offer them stern, realistic criticism, to set them tasks that will make them aware of how far they have to go. In fact, this indulgence and fear of hurting people’s feelings is far more abusive in the long run. It makes it hard for people to gauge where they are or to develop self- discipline. It makes them unsuited for the rigors of the journey to mastery. It weakens people’s will.

**Page 191**
> Accustom yourself to criticism.

## SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE

**Page 204**
> The principal problem we face in the social arena is our naïve tendency to project onto people our emotional needs and desires of the moment.

## THINKING INSIDE

**Page 209**
> in all of his future interactions with people, he would force himself to take an initial step backward and not get emotional.

**Page 211**
> In executing this strategy, Franklin noticed how free he was from any feelings of bitterness or anger toward Keimer. It was all maneuvers on a chessboard, and by thinking inside Keimer he was able to play the game to perfection, with a clear and level head.

## KEYS TO MASTERY

**Page 215**
> To become indignant at [people’s] conduct is as foolish as to be angry with a stone because it rolls into your path.

**Page 217**
> Social intelligence is nothing more than the process of discarding the Naïve Perspective and approaching something more realistic. It involves focusing our attention outward instead of inward, honing the observational and empathic skills that we naturally possess. It means moving past our tendency to idealize and demonize people, and seeing and accepting them as they are.

**Page 220**
> This new clarity about your perspective should be accompanied by an adjustment of your attitude. You must avoid the temptation to become cynical in your approach as an overreaction to your prior naïveté. The most effective attitude to adopt is one of supreme acceptance.

## Specific Knowledge—Reading People

**Page 223**
> To begin this process, you need to train yourself to pay less attention to the words that people say and greater attention to their tone of voice, the look in their eye, their body language— all signals that might reveal a nervousness or excitement that is not expressed verbally. If you can get people to become emotional, they will reveal a lot more.

**Page 225**
> You must avoid the common mistake of making judgments based on your initial impressions of people. Such impressions can sometimes tell you something, but more often they are misleading. There are several reasons for this. In your initial encounter you tend to be nervous, less open, and more inward. You are not really paying attention. Furthermore, people have trained themselves to appear a certain way; they have a persona they use in public that acts like a second skin to protect them.

## General Knowledge—The Seven Deadly Realities

**Page 228**
> People who praise you too much or who become overly friendly in the first stages of knowing you are often envious and are getting closer in order to hurt you. You should be wary of such behavior.

**Page 228**
> You must be particularly careful to never make people feel stupid in your presence. Intelligence is the most sensitive trigger point for envy. In general, it is by standing out too much that you will spark this ugly emotion, and so it is best to maintain a nonthreatening exterior and to blend in well with the group, at least until you are so successful it no longer matters.

**Page 229**
> Think of the workplace as a kind of theater in which you are always wearing a mask. (Reserve your most interesting and colorful thoughts for your friends, and for those whom you can trust outside work.) Be careful in what you say— it is not worth the bother of freely expressing your opinions.

**Page 231**
> you must understand and accept this Deadly Reality. When it is time to ask for a favor or help, you must think first of appealing to people’s self- interest in some way. (You should apply this to everyone, no matter their level of self- obsessiveness.) You must look at the world through their eyes, getting a sense of their needs.

**Page 234**
> they evade you and delay necessary action on something important to you, or make you feel guilty and leave you unsure why, or if they act harmfully but make it seem like an accident, you are most likely under a passive- aggressive attack. You have one of two options: either get out of their way and leave their presence, or return the attack with something equally indirect, signaling in some subtle way that messing with you will come with a price. This will often discourage them and make them find another victim. At all cost, avoid entangling yourself emotionally in their dramas and battles. They are masters at controlling the dynamic, and you will almost always lose in the end.

## 3. See yourself as others see you

**Page 253**
> The audience had the impression that she was simply repeating the same talk over and over, with the same slides, as if she were a machine. Strangely enough, none of this bothered Temple. In fact, the idea of these evaluations excited her. They gave her a clear and realistic picture of herself as others saw her, and that is all she ever needed for self- correction.

## KEYS TO MASTERY

**Page 278**
> We prefer to live with familiar ideas and habits of thinking, but we pay a steep price for this: our minds go dead from the lack of challenge and novelty; we reach a limit in our field and lose control over our fate because we become replaceable.

## Step One: The Creative Task

**Page 283**
> This is The Primary Law of the Creative Dynamic that you must engrave deeply in your mind and never forget: your emotional commitment to what you are doing will be translated directly into your work. If you go at your work with half a heart, it will show in the lackluster results and in the laggard way in which you reach the end. If you are doing something primarily for money and without a real emotional commitment, it will translate into something that lacks a soul and that has no connection to you.

**Page 284**
> If you are worried about what others might think and about how your position in the group might be jeopardized, then you will never really create anything. You will unconsciously tether your mind to certain conventions, and your ideas will grow stale and flat. If you are worried about failure or going through a period of mental and financial instability, then you will violate the Primary Law of the Creative Dynamic, and your worries will be reflected in the results. Think of yourself as an explorer. You cannot find anything new if you are unwilling to leave the shore.

## A. CULTIVATE NEGATIVE CAPABILITY

**Page 287**
> Truly creative people in all fields can temporarily suspend their ego and simply experience what they are seeing, without the need to assert a judgment, for as long as possible.

**Page 288**
> To put Negative Capability into practice, you must develop the habit of suspending the need to judge everything that crosses your path. You consider and even momentarily entertain viewpoints opposite to your own, seeing how they feel. You observe a person or event for a length of time, deliberately holding yourself back from forming an opinion. You seek out what is unfamiliar— for instance, reading books from unfamiliar writers in unrelated fields or from different schools of thought. You do anything to break up your normal train of thinking and your sense that you already know the truth.

## B. ALLOW FOR SERENDIPITY

**Page 294**
> To help yourself to cultivate serendipity, you should keep a notebook with you at all times. The moment any idea or observation comes, you note it down. You keep the notebook by your bed, careful to record ideas that come in those moments of fringe awareness— just before falling asleep, or just upon waking. In this notebook you record any scrap of thought that occurs to you, and include drawings, quotes from other books, anything at all. In this way, you will have the freedom to try out the most absurd ideas. The juxtaposition of so many random bits will be enough to spark various associations.

## Complacency

**Page 319**
> Constantly remind yourself of how little you truly know, and of how mysterious the world remains.

## 3. Mechanical Intelligence

**Page 347**
> What you are trying to create will not magically take off after a few creative bursts of inspiration, but must be slowly evolved through a step- by- step process as you correct the flaws.

## 4. Natural Powers

**Page 354**
> you must come to embrace slowness as a virtue in itself. When it comes to creative endeavors, time is always relative. Whether your project takes months or years to complete, you will always experience a sense of impatience and a desire to get to the end. The single greatest action you can take for acquiring creative power is to reverse this natural impatience.

## 5. The Open Field

**Page 361**
> The process goes as follows: You begin by looking inward. You have something you want to express that is unique to yourself and related to your inclinations. You must be sure it is not something that is sparked by some trend or fashion, but that it comes from you and is real. Perhaps it is a sound you are not hearing in music, a type of story not being told, a type of book that does not fit into the usual tidy categories. Perhaps it is even a new way of doing business. Let the idea, the sound, the image take root in you.

## 7. The Evolutionary Hijack

**Page 374**
> The lesson is simple— what constitutes true creativity is the openness and adaptability of our spirit. When we see or experience something we must be able to look at it from several angles, to see other possibilities beyond the obvious ones.

## KEYS TO MASTERY

**Page 409**
> We don’t simply absorb information— we internalize it and make it our own by finding some way to put this knowledge to practical use. We look for connections between the various elements we are learning, hidden laws that we can perceive in the apprenticeship phase.

## The Roots of Masterly Intuition

**Page 418**
> This desire for what is simple and easy infects all of us, often in ways we are mostly unaware of. The only solution is the following: We must learn how to quiet the anxiety we feel whenever we are confronted with anything that seems complex or chaotic.

## 1. Connect to your environment—Primal Powers

**Page 430**
> Understand: the ability to connect deeply to your environment is the most primal and in many ways the most powerful form of mastery the brain can bring us.

## The Fingertip Feel

**Page 454**
> is time to reverse this prejudice against conscious effort and to see the powers we gain through practice and discipline as eminently inspiring and even miraculous.

## REVERSAL

**Page 490**
> Alienating yourself from your inclinations can only lead to pain and disappointment in the long run, and a sense that you have wasted something unique. This pain will be expressed in bitterness and envy, and you will not recognize the true source of your depression.

**Page 490**
> Genius too does nothing but learn first how to lay bricks then how to build, and continually seek for material and continually form itself around it. Every activity of man is amazingly complicated, not only that of the genius: but none is a ‘miracle.’—FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE
